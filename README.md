### Digitalizing Process

#### Initial Test
- Installation of a 3-micron diameter stylus was conducted, followed by placement of the disc on the turntable.
- Upon activation, the speed indicator and strobe illuminator were illuminated.
- The rotation speed was adjusted to 78 RPM to align with the record specifications, and the Start/Stop button was engaged to initiate turntable platter rotation.
- The tone arm was positioned over the outer groove, with the cueing lever set to the down position, facilitating a gradual descent of the tone arm onto the record.
- Instability in the needle was observed due to disc rotation, resulting in a rapid traverse from the outer to the inner groove.
- Inspection of the stylus revealed it to be broken.
- Utilization of the phonograph's native stylus yielded a clear sound, albeit with some noise.

#### Recording Test
- Connection of the phonograph to an A/D converter was established through the Audio Archival Preamp MKII, ensuring reproduction of the phonograph disc sound without coloration or added background noise.
- Equalization was set to 78.
- Recording was initiated via Pro Tools, with the volume initially set to the minimum and subsequently increased gradually to achieve a balance between volume and wave.

#### Recording
- The presence of sharp noise was noted, although the music remained clear due to the distinct separation of noise and music frequencies.
- The sharp and pronounced noise was attributed to the use of an incorrect stylus.
- During the recording of Side B, distinct distortions were detected, indicative of the stylus jumping and trembling within the groove.
- The phonograph's native stylus was determined to be thicker than the correct stylus, which features a truncated tip.

### Audio Restoration Steps
-  **Denoise**: Initial noise reduction using RX software.
   - Parameters: Threshold at 0, Reduction at -15 dB.
   - Conducted multiple passes to refine noise reduction.

-  **Declick**: Removal of click noises.
   - Parameters: Sensitivity at 3.8, Frequency Skew at 8.6, Click Widening at 2.7 ms.
   - Applied multiple times to ensure effective removal of clicks.

-  **Manual Cleaning**: Detailed manual removal of residual noises.
   - Involved zooming into the spectrum to identify and delete unwanted sounds.
